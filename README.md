#Labs

This repo is from now on a generic lab/testing ground, right now i am testing and learning datastracture and algorithms and i wanted too have a place were i could play around with a code.




Just a repository that i have a test code or code that do stuff that no one else in the entire universe would wanna run or have any use for except for possible me.
The latest code was just a test for a theory i had about how you can reuse data and try getting a match on possible properties, could possible make it a lot better by using something i forgot the english word for so nevermind.
